# EvoSuite Experiment Scripts

To use this script to run experiments you need to pull [my EvoSuite fork](https://github.com/kevNii/evosuite) in this directory, along with the [SF110 corpus](http://evosuite.org/experimental-data/) and the [subjects folder of the MOSA/DynaMOSA replication pack](https://selab.fbk.eu/kifetew/downloads/subjects-icst15.tar).

To run `VD_A.py`, which analyzes the result you first need to install the dependencies in `requirements.txt`.
